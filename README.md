## 🔄 Tracking Progress

Use the dashboard at the top to track progress. To mark items complete:
- Edit this README and change a checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]`.
- Or open an issue and submit a PR when you complete a task so changes are reviewed.

### How to use this roadmap
- Prioritize P1 → P6 in order; focus on one milestone at a time.
- Convert large topics into smaller actionable tasks (issues) and track them via GitHub.
- Add estimated durations and target dates for your personal plan.
- Keep notes and links to implementations under each topic as you complete them.

### Contributing
- If you find an error or want to suggest a change, open an issue first (brief description + rationale).
- For content edits, submit a PR updating this README.md. Use clear commit messages and link related issues.
- Keep changes focused and minimal; prefer adding resources/links or small clarifications over large rewrites.
